- 👋 Hi, I’m @ohjorny
- 👀 I’m interested in math and programming. Wish I went to school for programming but a day late and a dollar short. For the past 2-3 years I've been self studying and have learned alot. It's been fun and I even made a website for my mom: 4jevents.com
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build websites using Vite. I also have several months of experience in SQL, Python, C++, and Java. I'm trying to make a 2D game using Python and I think it would be fun to try to create an application using C++/Win32. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building front end applications and other software programs possibly. 
- 📫 How to reach me: jpaperny97@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I met a governor and didn't even realize it
